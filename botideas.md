# list of ideas for bots

Feel free to use these for insipiration or just plain implement them yourself.
It'd be cool if you let me know about it though.

- exoplanets - Tweets procedurally-generated fictional exoplanets. Could
  possibly source from the Wikipedia list of exoplanets and their descriptions.
- fserve - like the old fserve bots from IRC times but via twitter
- cmdline - generates fake shell commands / scripts
